variable	description
experiment	ID of C1 chip (i.e. processing date in YYYYMMDD)
well	Well of C1 chip (96 total, rows A-H, cols 1-12)
cell_number	The number of cells observed in the well via microscopy
concentration	The cDNA concentration of the well prior to library prep
ERCC	Individual # 1 included on this C1 chip
individual.1	Individual # 2 included on this C1 chip
individual.2	The dilution factor of the ERCC spike-ins
raw	The number of raw reads
umi	The number of reads with a valid UMI
mapped	The number of reads with a valid UMI that mapped to a genome
unmapped	The number of reads with a valid UMI that did *not* map to a genome
reads_ercc	The number of reads that mapped to the ERCC spike-in transcripts
reads_hs	The number of reads that mapped to the H. sapiens genome
molecules	The number of molecules (i.e. post UMI-deduplication)
mol_ercc	The number of molecules that mapped to the ERCC spike-in transcripts
mol_hs	The number of molecules that mapped to the H. sapiens genome
detect_ercc	The number of ERCC genes with at least one molecule
detect_hs	The number of H. sapiens genes with at least one molecule
chip_id	verifyBamID: The predicted individual based on the sequencing data
chipmix	verifyBamID: chipmix is a metric for detecting sample swaps
freemix	verifyBamID: freemix is a measure of contamination. 0 == good & 0.5 == bad
snps	verifyBamID: The number of SNPs that passed thresholds for AF and missingness
reads	verifyBamID: The number of sequences that overlapped SNPs
avg_dp	verifyBamID: The average sequencing depth that covered a SNP
min_dp	verifyBamID: A minimun depth threshold for QC only (affects snps_w_min)
snps_w_min	verifyBamID: The number of SNPs that had the minimum depth (min_dp); QC only
valid_id	verifyBamID: Is the predicted individual 1 of the 4 added to the C1 chip?
