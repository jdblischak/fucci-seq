cut_off_reads	QC filter: number of mapped reads > 85th percentile among zero-cell samples
unmapped_ratios	QC filter: among reads with a valid UMI, number of unmapped/number of mapped (unmapped/umi)
cut_off_unmapped	QC filter: unmapped ratio < 30th percentile among zero-cell samples
ercc_percentage	QC filter: number of reads mapped to ERCC/total sample mapped reads (reads_ercc/mapped)
cut_off_ercc	QC filter: ercc percentage < 15th percentile among zero-cell samples
cut_off_genes	QC filter: number of endogeneous genes with at least one molecule (detect_hs) > 85th percentile among zero-cell samples
ercc_conversion	QC filter: among ERCC, number of molecules/number of mapped reads (mol_ercc/reads_ercc)
conversion	QC filter: among endogeneous genes, number of molecules/number of mapped reads (mol_hs/reads_hs)
conversion_outlier	QC filter: microscoy detects 1 cell AND ERCC conversion rate > .094
filter_all	QC filter: Does the sample pass all the QC filters? cell_number==1, mol_egfp >0, valid_id==1, cut_off_reads==TRUE, cut_off_ercc==TRUE, cut_off_genes=TRUE
