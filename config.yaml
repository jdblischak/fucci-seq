# The variables in this file control the behavior of the Snakefile at the root
# of the project. It starts with raw sequencing reads in FASTQ files and
# converts them to gene counts.

# Paths ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following paths must be updated to run the scripts on your machine.

# Paths must end with forward slash

dir_proj: /project2/gilad/joycehsiao/fucci-seq

# Enter the absolute path to a scratch directory for writing intermediate files
scratch: /scratch/midway2/joycehsiao/fucci-seq

# Enter the absolute path to the directory which contains the image files
dir_image_data: /project2/gilad/fucci-seq/

# Enter the path (absolute or relative to the Snakefile) for writing log
