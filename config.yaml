# Snakemake configuration file
#
# The variables in this file control the behavior of the Snakefile at the root
# of the project. It starts with raw sequencing reads in FASTQ files and
# converts them to gene counts.

# Paths ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following paths must be updated to run the scripts on your machine.

# Paths must end with forward slash

# Enter the path (absolute or relative to the Snakefile) to the local directory
# to store the final data files.
dir_data: data/

# Enter the absolute path to an external directory to store intermediate files.
# It should also contain a subdirectory fastq/ which contains the raw gzipped
# FASTQ files.
dir_external: /project2/gilad/fucci-seq/

# Enter the path (absolute or relative to the Snakefile) for writing log
# files. Make sure to also update this path for log files in cluster.json
dir_log: log/

# Samples ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Select which samples to run. You should select a subset when first configuring
# and testing the pipeline.
